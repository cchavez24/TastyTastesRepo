    <ul>
      <li>1 box (18.5 Ounce) German<br>Chocolate Cake Mix (I Used<br>Duncan Hines)</li>
      <li>1 cup Finely Chopped Pecans</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Evaporated Milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Evaporated Milk (additional)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Butter, Melted</li>
      <li>60 whole Caramels, Unwrapped</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Powdered Sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="ingredients-h3">INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

    <div class="instructions-container">
    
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>
    
    <p>In a large bowl, mix together cake mix, chopped pecans, 1/3 cup evaporated milk, and melted butter. Stir together until totally combined. Mixture will be very thick.</p>
    
    <p>Press half the mixture into a well-greased 9 x 9 inch square baking pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and set aside.</p>
    
    <p>In a double boiler (or a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of boiling water) melt caramels with additional 1/2 cup evaporated milk. When melted and combined, pour over brownie base. Sprinkle chocolate chips as evenly as you can over the caramel.</p>
    
    <p>Turn out remaining brownie dough on work surface. Use your hands to press it into a large square a little smaller than the pan. Use a spatula to remove it from the surface, then set it on top of the caramel and chocolate chips.</p>
    
    <p>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from pan and allow to cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for several hours. When ready to serve, generously sift powdered sugar over the surface of the brownies. Cut into either nine or twelve helpings, and carefully remove from the pan.</p>
    
    <p>*Adapted from the classic "Knock You Naked Brownies" recipe, based on a dessert at the Salt Creek Steakhouse in Breckenridge. These brownies don't really knock you naked...but almost.</p>

    <p class="body-recipe">Goodness. You have to try these.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">Here’s how it shakes out. Several weeks ago, I was gifted with a tin of brownies. To be specific: Killer Brownies from
    Dorothy Lane Market in Dayton, Ohio. There were four substantially-sized brownies in the tin, and each brownie was
    coated generously with a sifting of powdered sugar. But they weren’t just any brownies: they were multilayered, with a
    gorgeous caramel oozing out of the center layer. And the flavor. To die for. I ate them over the period of several days, more despondent with each bite that I was one step closer to being without them. And I didn’t ever want to be without them again.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">They’re one of the best things I’ve ever tasted.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">While an official recipe for the Killer Brownies is not available, the classic layered brownie recipe known as “Knock You Naked Brownies” is rumored to be a pretty good match.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">I decided to whip up a batch over the weekend and see if they measured up. I’d never tried them before.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">It was all in the name of research, of course.</p>

    <img class="body-img" src="images/cake-mix.jpg" alt="Cake mix">

    <p class="body-recipe">Start by dumping this into a large mixing bowl.</p> 
    
    <p class="body-recipe">What’s “this” you ask?</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/german-chocolate.jpg" alt="German Chocolate cake mix">

    <p class="body-recipe">It’s German Chocolate cake mix.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">Not Devil’s Food.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">Not Chocolate Fudge.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">German Chocolate.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">And if you’re not a cake mix person, don’t worry: because of the way the ingredients are combined, the end result just doesn’t have a box mix flavor. Promise.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/pecans.jpg" alt="Pecans">

    <p class="body-recipe">Finely chop up some pecans.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/chopped-nuts.jpg" alt="Chopped pecans">

    <p class='body-recipe'>You’ll need about a cup of chopped nuts, which you’ll remember is quite different from a cup of nuts, chopped.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/butter.jpg" alt="Butter">

    <p class="body-recipe">You’ll also need some melted butter…</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/evaporated-milk.jpg" alt="Evaporated milk">

    <p class="body-recipe">And some evaporated milk.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/milk-mix.jpg" alt="Milk being poured into cake mix">

    <p class="body-recipe">Pour the evaporated milk over the cake mix.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/butter-mix.jpg" alt="Butter being poured into cake mix">

    <p class="body-recipe">Then add the butter…</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/nuts-mix.jpg" alt="Chopped pecans being poured into cake mix">

    <p class="body-recipe">And the nuts.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/cookie-dough.jpg" alt="Cake batter that looks like cookie dough">

    <p class="body-recipe">Stir together until totally combined. It’ll be very, very thick–not at all like cake batter. More like a thick cookie dough.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/pan.jpg" alt="Baking pan">

    <p class="body-recipe">Spray a square (either 8 x 8 or 9 x 9) baking pan very generously with nonstick cooking spray.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/half-dough.jpg" alt="Dough divided in half">

    <p class="body-recipe">Divide the dough in half…</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/pan-dough.jpg" alt="Dough in baking pan">

    <p class="body-recipe">And press half the dough into the bottom of the pan. Stick it in the oven for eight minutes.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/caramels.jpg" alt="Caramel squares">

    <p class="body-recipe">Caramels!</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/caramel-bowl.jpg" alt="Bowl of caramel squares">

    <p class="body-recipe">Peel ’em. Put ’em in a bowl.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/caramel-milk.jpg" alt="Milk being poured on caramel squares">

    <p class="body-recipe">Pour in some evaporated milk.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/melted.jpg" alt="Melted caramel">

    <p class="body-recipe">Heat it over the double boiler, stirring frequently, until the mixture is smooth and melted.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/oven.jpg" alt="Cookie dough in baking pan ready for oven">

    <p class="body-recipe">Pull the pan out of the oven.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/caramel-pan.jpg" alt="Caramel being drizzled on dough">

    <p class="body-recipe">And pour the caramel over the top.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/chocolate-chips.jpg" alt="Cup of chocolate chips">

    <p class="body-recipe">Now, this is optional: grab some chocolate chips. I say “optional” because I don’t think the brownies I received as a gift and loved with all my heart and dreamed about for weeks and fainted after eating had the inclusion of chocolate in the caramel layer.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/chocolate-pan.jpg" alt="Chocolate chips being poured on top of caramel">

    <p class="body-recipe">In any event, I would ultimately determine that the amount the recipe calls for–one whole cup–was too much. I cut it down to 1/3 cup in the final printable recipe.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/chocolate-dough.jpg" alt="Other half of cake mixture">

    <p class="body-recipe">Next, grab the other half of the cake mixture. The original recipe says to pour it over the top of the pan, but it’s thick and anything but pourable. So I just roughly formed a large square with my hands.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">(I think you could also spoon the mixture over the top, but I was afraid it would have too rough a texture.)</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/dough-top.jpg" alt="Square of dough on top of baking pan">

    <p class="body-recipe">Carefully place the square of dough on top…</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/bake.jpg" alt="Baking pan ready to be put in the oven">

    <p class="body-recipe">And bake it for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top layer appears “done.”</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/mess.jpg" alt="Baking pan after taken out of the oven">

    <p class="body-recipe">This looks like a seriously delicious mess, that’s all I know. And I say “mess” in the most wonderful sense.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">Now, this is important: you are not allowed to eat the brownies now.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">I know. I’m cruel. But because of the gooeyness of the ingredients, the brownies must be cooled, then refrigerated for several hours in order to set the ingredients together. So whatever you do, DO NOT make this recipe if you’re in the throes of a wicked chocolate craving. In fact, eat a piece of chocolate before you make the recipe. Only then will you have the strength to resist…and refrigerate.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/sugar.jpg" alt="Powdered sugar being sprinkled on top of baking pan">

    <p class="body-recipe">After refrigerating, when you’re ready to dig in, sprinkle the top very generously with powdered sugar.</p>

    <p class="body-recipe">And when I say generously, I mean really lay it on, sister. Brother, if you’re male. The brownies I received as a gift had a decidedly thick layer of powdered sugar anchored to the top, and this is part of what made them special.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/divide-brownies.jpg" alt="Finished brownies divided in half">

    <p class="body-recipe">You can divide the brownies however you’d like. I decided to make one large brownie for Marlboro Man, and one large
    brownie for me.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/six-brownies.jpg" alt="Six brownies cut up in baking pan">

    <p class="body-recipe">Just kidding, but I did take the oversized route and divide the pan into just six large brownies.</p>

    <p class="body-recipe">But nine would be much more sensible.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe">But I’ve never really had much sense when it comes to dessert.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/finished-brownies.jpg" alt="Finished brownies on a plate">

    <p class="body-recipe">Hello, my beautiful lover. Come away with me.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/plated-brownies.jpg" alt="Finished brownies on a plate">
    
    <p class="body-recipe">Let’s examine: first of all, you’ll see what I mean about the excessive chocolate. Granted, I did use a square pan
    instead of the 9 x 13-incher the recipe calls for, so the gooeyness is more pronounced. But this is definitely more
    chocolate than the brownies need; you want the caramel to be the star. But that aside: look at the deliciousness. I only refrigerated for one hour since I was chasing daylight; ideally, I would have had more time to mitigate the ooze factor.</p>

    <img class="img-alt" src="images/verdict.jpg" alt="Finished brownies being picked up to eat">

    <p class="body-recipe">The verdict is this: I was actually quite amazed at how close these tasted to the gifted brownies I received. Of course, nothing can quite measure up to the Dorothy Lane brownie experience–it was life-changing. But this recipe is right behind it. I’ll make it again and again.</p>
    
    <p class="body-recipe body-p">Incidentally, if you need a special food gift to send to a friend, family member, or business associate, I’d highly recommend a tin of Killer Brownies. They definitely make a statement.</p>
